All right. This is kind of weird to talk about. Since we left the mines, I've... started hearing voices. Two of them. Not all the time; just when I'm arguing with myself. One of the voices argues for, I don't know, chaos and ego; the other one encourages focus and calm. What's weirder is that I recognize the voices, 'cause they belong to people I know. They're *my* thoughts, but I hear *them* speaking.

## Grammie Pluto

The voice of ego is my mother's mother: Grammie Pluto, honored matriarch of the *Winds and Thorns*. She's the one telling me to look out for myself. By the time I was crewing the *Jagged Scabbard*, she had effectively retired from topside. That was in no small part to having lost her arm... and my grandfather. But she was an honorary boatswain. She was managing new recruits, giving lessons to us kids, generally keeping the ship in order below deck.

I remember she had always been popular with the crew, old *and* new, but I hadn't realized *how* admired she was... until one night, we were moored at a small port town somewhere along the Sword Coast. I woke up hearing this boisterous laughter and singing coming from the local tavern. So I managed to sneak off the ship and I saw this raucous crowd that was egging Grammie on to tell another story.

She leapt onto a table and said, "All right, quiet down ya swine, this'll be the last one for the night!" Then she told them the story of the night my grandfather died. It was the first time I heard the story in such detail.

The story went like this:

In a few days would be a prince's 12th birthday, and a royal gala was being prepared in his honor. A cargo ship had been sent ahead, quietly, with a minimal escort. But it was filled with gifts and tributes and fireworks and other festive things. "They'd prefer nothing happened to the goods, mind, but won't worth a full fleet of galleons for some spoiled brat." That shipment was made out to be a trade delivery of livestock and cheap baubles. But, one of our spymasters got word to the captain. They intercepted and looted the cargo, easy. Grammie never admitted it, but I always assumed she was the spy.

Well, later that night, it became clear that it was a double-cross. They had been fed the information so they'd take the blame for the plunder. And somehow a raiding crew was able to sneak up beside the *Scabbard* and board. They were caught fully unaware, and soon the entire crew was fighting off the raiders. Grammie said, "It was sorcery at play. Quiet like the butterflies, hidden as the roaches. But they stung like the hornets." On the horizon, brigantines had started to surround them. The raiders wanted the loot, and they wouldn't mind having the *Scabbard*, so they held back on cannon blasts. They only fired enough to make it harder for us to maneuver.

They cornered and slayed the captain in short order. Grammie said, "A fine man. A true loss to the *Winds and Thorns*, and one I might say we never recovered from." Then she offered a brief moment of silence. After that, she said, "We were besieged and beheaded. We could wish for reinforcements but that was a fool's wish. We needed something bolder, but we were out of time."

The crew of the *Scabbard* was suffering deep losses. The raiders' brigantines enclosed on our ship but kept some distance. She said, "Then, it was over. We had nary anyone left to defend the *Scabbard*. The quartermaster ordered the crew to abandon the ship, and the raiders sent up the signal that the bounty had been secured. The crew watched them escort the *Scabbard* away, deserted."

I saw Grammie set down salt and pepper shakers on one side of a long table, as stand-ins for the crew. Then she pushed a serving tray with various plates and bowls across to the other side of the table. And those were the *Scabbard* and its escorts. What she *didn't* say in her tale was that the quartermaster was her husband, my grandfather, but everyone who was listening knew.

She said, "The wily scoundrel what oversaw the attack began to board." Then she laid down a dinner knife so it bridged across two bowls. Then she walked over to the wall, by a lit sconce. "The crew watched in sorrow." She removed the torch, and returned to the table. "And then." With that, she raised the torch, held it up for a brief moment, and struck it down on the bowl that represented the *Scabbard*. She shattered it. That knife somersaulted before landing on the ground. She said, "Our sailors of the *Winds and Thorns* saw the *Rusty Scabbard* explode in a spectacle of flame and fireworks." 

So it was true: on orders of my grandfather, the crew had left the ship. They confiscated the small boats that the raiding party had abandoned. But the raiders had not *meant* to abandon them. Our crew had defeated the raiders, but they kept up the ruse of a battle just long enough for Grammie, and Grampa, and ranking crew to rig the cargo. Grampa fired the signal once evacuation had begun and cloaked himself in the dress of the main who killed our captain. Grammie stayed hidden in the hold to ignite the fuses once the time was right. By the time their commander boarded and saw the deception, Grammie had already lit the fuses and was finding her way off the the ship.

Artillery was rigged to fire as well, sending volleys of lead, shrapnel, explosives into the brigantines. Grammie watched from a small outrigger while holding a small talisman. It was something they took from the raiders, after they realized the talismans had the magic that gave them stealth. She expected my grandfather to join her, but he never did. She watched the *Rusty Scabbard* go down, taking three of the brigantines with it. Those raiders knew more vessels from the *Winds and Thorns* would come looking soon, so the remaining ships retreated.

At that point Grammie was seated atop the dining table. She was staring out at the distance as if re-enacting that morning. She used an empty drinking tin to snuff out the torch and said, "Took me a sharp hour to accept that he didn't make it. I was still covered in soot and about frozen from the bitter air when I met up with the crew.

"To this day, on our trips lubbin' on the land, I still fancy hearing his voice. Think the old man might've stole off with his totem and made his own adventure. But I've not seen -- or smelt -- a ghost of that man. Just a voice that blows with me, like the wind."

I don't know; I guess that's a magic they share, now.
## Master Sakana

After Grammie's voice tells me I should light the whole thing on fire and start anew, Master Sakana's voice reminds me to take a breath and envision stillness and peace.

Master Sakana was -- well, *is* -- a courier for the village. Some of his trips were quite long. I had already been at the village for a year before I met him. He had just returned from one of his journeys, and he seemed to take a quick interest in me. I don't know if it's because I was a curiosity amongst his people, or because I was still a bit brash and arrogant. He had some time before he would leave again with a new bunch of letters and parcels, so in the meantime he recruited me to help him with some tasks and chores.

The first task was fishing. You might be surprised to learn that not all pirates fish, especially the son of captains and spies. I had already been learning to fish, but I was neither skilled at nor very interested in it. But for the village, it was an important source of food and everyone learned how to cast a line once you could trust them to not drown as soon as you looked away.

Instead of taking me to the main pier that tapped the sea, he took me to a lake that's a small hike from the village proper. So he found a bit of ground to his liking, and he sat and had me sit, and handed me a rod, and he gestured to the lake. And then I cast the line carelessly. Maybe somewhat in protest. All he said was "Calm your mind, young man." So for the rest of the morning, even when I complained that there were no fish to catch and that there were better things I could be doing (neither of which were true), he said nothing else. And then eventually, I got frustrated and returned to the village alone. Then later that evening, he didn't say a word, but he brought me a fish dinner.

I met him again the next morning, and he asked if I was ready to fish. He acted like I didn't walk off the day before like a spoiled brat. So we returned to the lake.

He, again, offered me no instruction. Whenever I threw a line, without fail, he'd say, "Calm your mind, young man." He wasn't even watching me. He would cast his line, secure his rod somewhere, and close his eyes. But he always knew what I was doing. At one point, he had a bite on his line and he made no attempt to pull it in, and when I fussed at him about it, he picked up a fish from his bucket, tossed it at my face -- still without looking: "Calm your mind, young man."

We didn't go fishing every day, 'cause some days there were more pressing tasks to be done. But when we were free, we went to the lake. He caught fish. I did not. One day on the walk back I was a little heated, 'cause I was getting self-conscious about returning empty-handed. I asked him why he wouldn't *teach* me to fish. Then he stopped, smiled at me, and said "Tomorrow, I will teach you to fish." And then he started walking again.

The routine went the same: we hiked to the lake, he found a spot that felt right to him, handed me a fishing rod, and said, "Calm your mind, young man." I threw the rod down and cursed. "You said you'd teach me!"

He sat and tossed his line. "When you throw your hook, what are you thinking about?"

"I don't know", I said. "Where the fish will be, how deep they'll be swimming, what they want to eat."

With his eyes closed, he said, "Is that true?"

"Yes!" I picked up my rod and whipped the line into the lake. I waited for him to tell me to *calm my mind, young man*, but he stayed silent. I was close to cursing again, but realized I tossed the line in without considering where the fish would be, or how deep, or even checking if I had bait on the hook.

"How long have you been here?"

I didn't answer him immediately because I was a little surprised by the question. "Fifteen months."

"And how long *will* you be here?"

I almost dismissed the question as absurd. As short a time as possible, I thought, but how could I know? I was just biding time until the *Jagged Scabbard* returned. Every day I was expecting them to show up. Every day I wanted my belongings to be ready to toss into a sack and carry off on short notice. When I would go to the pier to fish, I watched the horizon for the *Winds and Thorns* flag.

...But I couldn't do that on the lake. I realized that was on purpose. I also realized that didn't stop me from daydreaming about their return, about my parents, about Grammie and her stories, about adventures far away from the village.

"I don't know", I finally answered. I brought my hook back in, added the missing bait, tossed it back out, and sat down.

"Calm your mind, young man."

That evening, Master Sakana showed me how to cook the fish I caught.
